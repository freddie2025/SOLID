# S.O.L.I.D.
A simple definition and in depth code example describing each of the famous S.O.L.I.D. principles.

|        | Principle      |
| ------ |:--------------:|
| S | Single Repsonsbility  |
| O | Open-Closed           |
| L | Liskov's Substitution |
| I | Interface Segregation |
| D | Dependency Inversion  |

### Single Repsonsbility Principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
### Open-Closed Principle
Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### Liskov's Substitution Principle
Subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.
1. Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
2. Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype.
3. Invariants of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
### Interface Segregation Principle
A Client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use.
### Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions (Depend on Abstractions not on concretions).
